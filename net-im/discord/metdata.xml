                Discord Gaming Messenger.
                
                This package installs Discord Messenger.  It allow
                the installation of stable, public test build (ptb),
                and alpha (canary) versions, managed by use flag.
                
                Note that since this does not track specific packages
                and release numbers of Discord, it may be necessary
                from time to time to clean all Discord software
                in /usr/portage/distfiles and perform an:
                ebuild {discord ebuild} digest
                to update portage with newer versions of the software.
                
                This can be identified when Discord states an update
                is available.
                
                Eventually, the canary dependencies will need to be
                moved into the other versions of the release.
